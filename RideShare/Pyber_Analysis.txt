2) Pyber rides have lower average fares in Urban cities; this may be due to a higher supply of drivers in those locations, shorter average distances, or other factors.

3) Rural cities account for about 6.8% of total fares, 5.3% of total rides, and 2.6% of total drivers.  Rural cities also have the highest average fare per ride, and this may be due to longer rides, lower supply of drivers, or other factors.
